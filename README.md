## How to run

Before running the application or any tests, make sure you are in the project's root directory. After that you have to run `npm install`.

### Running the application

You can then run the application locally by using `npm run dev`. This will make the application accessible at localhost.

### Running the tests

You can run the tests by using `npm run test`. This will run all the tests, including snapshot and unit tests.

### Accessing the application through the VM

If you are connected to an NTNU-associated network or if you are using the NTNU-distributed VPN, you can access the app at [http://it2810-05.idi.ntnu.no/project1](http://it2810-05.idi.ntnu.no/project1).

## About

### Type of application to create

All group members are familiar with weather forecasting services like [Yr.no](https://www.yr.no/nb). We created an application for weather forecasts because we believed it would be a good way of fulfilling the functional and technical criteria given to us.

### Design

**Design first**

We decided to design the application in figma before coding the different components. That way we ensured a cohesive, good looking, design. This also gave us an overview over what components needed to be created, which made it easy to create issues in advance. This again made planning much easier, and lead to fewer meetings being necessary.

|        The design for desktop        |

**Mobile first design**

It is very easy to start designing an application for desktop, only to then later realize that what is on desktop does not fit on mobile form factors. For this reason we have been practicing mobile first design, meaning we have initially designed the application for mobile form factors. After having established the mobile design, we have moved on to optimizing the design for desktop as well.

**Accessability**

We have used a high-contrast color palette to make the application more accessible for people with visual impairments. Additionally, we utilized the Contrast Checker Bookmarklet to ensure that all text and background combinations meet the WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. We've also been cautious about the use of div elements, opting for more semantic HTML tags such as button and span where appropriate, to further improve accessibility and ensure screen readers correctly interpret the page structure.

### API

**What Rest API we chose**

[We chose the API provided by Meteorologisk Institutt (MET) for developers](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation). We chose this API because we already knew about it as the proud Norwegians we are, and because its super simple to get weather information from different locations, just paste in the latitude and longitude coordinates into the base-URL, and in response you get all the weather information you require about that location:

> [https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?**lat=60.10**&**lon=9.58**](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?lat=60.10&lon=9.58)

MET also provides several different methods for getting differing amounts of information:

- Compact
- Classic
- Complete

Because of the relatively short deadline, we chose to implement an application using the **compact** method. This gave us an easier and simpler API to work with, but in turn we got a reduced amount of information, meaning we for example did not get the UV of the different locations.

Here is a cutout of the response we get from the above base-URL which shows all the information we use in the application (we don't use all of this information, but most of it):

```JSON
[...]


    "timeseries": [
      {
        "time": "2024-09-19T13:00:00Z",
        "data": {
          "instant": {
            "details": {
              "air_pressure_at_sea_level": 1033,
              "air_temperature": 17.5,
              "cloud_area_fraction": 0,
              "relative_humidity": 60.6,
              "wind_from_direction": 178.3,
              "wind_speed": 1.5
            }
          },

[...]

          },
          "next_1_hours": {
            "summary": {
              "symbol_code": "clearsky_day"
            },
            "details": {
              "precipitation_amount": 0
            }
          },

[...]
```

**Caching the API responses**

The standard settings of TanStack useQuery is a staleTime of 0 and a garbage-collection of 5 minutes. To reduce API calls we changed both these variables to 15 minutes. That way we will at most call the API once for every city every 15 minutes (unless the page is refreshed)

```javascript
export const useWeatherQuery = (lat: string, lon: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [lat, lon], // Query key for caching
    queryFn: () => fetchWeather(lat, lon).then( ... }),),
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 15, // 15 minutes
    gcTime: 1000 * 60 * 15, //Stop garbage collection from happening after 5 minutes
  });
};

```

The query key for the caching was chosen to be the latitude and longitude as it is unique for all cities. Originally we thought about using the name of the city and the name of the country, however in theory two different locations could have the same city- and country name, making this a bad choice.

### CSS

**CSS modules**

CSS modules allows each component to have its own dedicated CSS file, which simplifies the styling process. This approach allows us to not worry about class name collisions, as each class is scoped to its own component. Additionally, it becomes easier to name classes, as they only need to be unique within the component and not the whole website. The downside to this is that it is more difficult to reuse CSS and thus makes it more difficult to have a cohesive design. To combat this we introduced global CSS variables for colors we use in `index.css`. That way we could use these variables in the individual components to make sure every component used the same color palette.

Colors defined in `Index.css`:

```CSS
:root {
  ...
  --primary-color: #2c434e;
  --secondary-color: #fffcfd;
  --tertiary-color: #aed2db;

  --inactive-border: #dddddd;
  --active-border: #b9b9b9;
  --active-border-blue: #007bff;
}
```

An example of use in `WeatherCard.module.css`

```CSS
.card {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: var(--secondary-color);
  ...
}
```

Another thing we did to ensure cohesive design, was to (loosely) follow that design in figma when we wrote the code and css for the different components.

## Test coverage

### Testing

**Snapshot tests**

Snapshot tests are a simple way to ensure no unexpected changes are made to components. We are using snapshot tests for most of our components to ensure that we avoid unexpected changes in the generated html.

**Unit tests**

We have unit tests for most of our components, the useWeather hook and the API-related code (with mocking). In these tests we check important attributes and functionalities. We however do not test the different pages, as the pages mainly just consist of components which are already well tested by unit tests.

**Mocking the API**

The first thing we did when setting up the tests, was to (globally) mock the fetchWeather-function that fetched data from the API. That way we made sure that the tests never needlessly called the API during testing. This however came with the downside that we never actually test the applications call to the actual API, meaning it will be more difficult to spot changes in the APIs response-format through just using tests. However, if the API stops working, all pages in the application will print error messages relating to the API. This means that it is still easy to spot problems with the API itself, all though it requires manual testing.

```javascript
vi.mock('../api/clients/weatherClient', () => ({
  fetchWeather: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    properties: {
      timeseries: [
        {
          data: {
            instant: {
              details: {
                air_pressure_at_sea_level: 10,
                air_temperature: 10,
                cloud_area_fraction: 10,
                relative_humidity: 10,
                wind_from_direction: 10,
                wind_speed: 10,
              },
            },
            next_1_hours: {
              details: {
                precipitation_amount: 10,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  }),
}));
```

**Manual testing**

We have also manually tested how the application looks on different web-browsers and mobile devices. We have tested the application on:

- Chrome (desktop)
- Firefox (desktop)
- Safari (desktop)
- Edge (desktop)
- Chrome (mobile)
- Firefox (mobile)

**Coverage**

## Warning when running the application

When running the tests, you may encounter the following warning the console:

```
[DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

This warning is not harmful and can be safely ignored. Downgrading Node.js could resolve the issue, but that would go against the project requirements.

## Lighthouse analysis of the application

["Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages"](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) Here are the results we got from analasys of our two pages; home (aka the list view) and location:

## Changes after first delivery

After reviewing the feedback on the first delivery we created a list of critiques that we should do something with to improve our application. Here is the list of critiques, and the issues we created to fix them:
| Critique | Solved in |
| -------- | --------- |
| Some divs could be exchanged with more semantic elements | **#66** Remove unnecessary divs |
| Lack of color in the application | **#63** Add color to the weathercard depending on temperature |
| Lack of pictures of the actual application in README | **#68** Add images to docs |
| A weird scaling issue was happening on the location page with the infoDisplay component on small screens | **#64** Change min-width of infoDisplay |
| That the "Other locations" title on the home page should just say "Locations" when no locations are favourited | **#62** Change title of Location section |
| Some icons, like the heart-icon, were too small | **#61** Adjust icon sizes |
| When scrolling down on the home-page, and clicking on a location, you were taken to the bottom of the location page, instead of top. | **#67** Fix scroll issue between pages |
| The next and previous locations in the carousel do not follow the sorting on the home page | **#60** Have the sorted locations in context |
